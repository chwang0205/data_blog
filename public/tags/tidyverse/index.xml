 What to Expect Iâ€™m excited to share pro-tips that will expedite your process for cleaning and standardizing column names in your data; this is a critical yet sometimes overlooked step in the cleaning + tidying of data.
There are a couple of handy functions() available in R to help effectively execute these tasks.
By the end of this short article youâ€™ll have a couple of new tricks up your sleeve for getting those column names just the way you want them ðŸ˜Ž</description>

      <description>Letâ€™s Dive into an Example Iâ€™m a nerd ðŸ¤“ when it comes to programming (esp.Â in R) and love learning about new functions.
Matt Dancho, early in his Data Science Foundations with R Course, teaches students the importance of examining data before diving into wrangling and exploring it further.
One of the functions Iâ€™ve adopted from the course is the glimpse() function - itâ€™s awesome and I use it all the time!</description>

Letâ€™s Dive Into an Example Iâ€™d like to share a technique using str_glue() that I learned from Matt Dancho, a Data-Science instructor at Business Science University. Check out my favorite course here: Business Analysis With R.
str_glue() from the stringr library is one of my favorite functions in R - Itâ€™s super helpful for wrangling and manipulating text in preparation for building advanced plots.</description>
