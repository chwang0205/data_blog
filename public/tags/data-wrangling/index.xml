Letâ€™s Dive into an Example Iâ€™m a nerd ðŸ¤“ when it comes to programming (esp.Â in R) and love learning about new functions.
Matt Dancho, early in his Data Science Foundations with R Course, teaches students the importance of examining data before diving into wrangling and exploring it further.</description>

Letâ€™s Dive Into an Example Iâ€™d like to share a technique using str_glue() that I learned from Matt Dancho, a Data-Science instructor at Business Science University. Check out my favorite course here: Business Analysis With R.
str_glue() from the stringr library is one of my favorite functions in R - Itâ€™s super helpful for wrangling and manipulating text in preparation for building advanced plots.</description>
