      <description>Quick Overview Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund wrote an incredible book called R for Data Science (R4DS). In the book they teach how to ‚Äúturn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.‚Äù The authors do this by being laser focused on the tools that help the data-practitioner import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data (+communicate findings):

 I dug into the chapter on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) this past week.</description>

 What to Expect I‚Äôm excited to share pro-tips that will expedite your process for cleaning and standardizing column names in your data; this is a critical yet sometimes overlooked step in the cleaning + tidying of data.
There are a couple of handy functions() available in R to help effectively execute these tasks.
By the end of this short article you‚Äôll have a couple of new tricks up your sleeve for getting those column names just the way you want them üòé</description>

      <description>Quick Overview Recently, I completed the Data Science for Business 101 course over at Business Science University. In the course, Matt Dancho teaches students the fundamentals of data science for business with the tidyverse.
The course is jam packed with material: from basic data wrangling all the way to applied machine learning - I highly recommend it to anyone looking to advance their skills ü§ì

      <description>Let‚Äôs Dive into an Example I‚Äôm a nerd ü§ì when it comes to programming (esp.¬†in R) and love learning about new functions.
Matt Dancho, early in his Data Science Foundations with R Course, teaches students the importance of examining data before diving into wrangling and exploring it further.
One of the functions I‚Äôve adopted from the course is the glimpse() function - it‚Äôs awesome and I use it all the time!</description>

Let‚Äôs Dive Into an Example I‚Äôd like to share a technique using str_glue() that I learned from Matt Dancho, a Data-Science instructor at Business Science University. Check out my favorite course here: Business Analysis With R.
str_glue() from the stringr library is one of my favorite functions in R - It‚Äôs super helpful for wrangling and manipulating text in preparation for building advanced plots.</description>
