### Let's Dive into an Example

I'm a nerd ðŸ¤“ when it comes to programming (esp. in `R`) and love learning about new functions.

Matt Dancho early in his R 101 course teaches students the importance of examining data before diving into wrangling and exploring it further.

One of the functions I've adopted from the course is the `glimpse()` function - it's awesome and I use it all the time!

### The glimse() function

When your data has a small number of columns you can print it to the console in `RStudio`. However, when there are many columns it's difficult to get a quick view of your data.

Let's look at an example so I can stress the value in using the `dplyr::glimpse()` function in the examination of your data.


### Let's Get Some Data

The [Tidy Tuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday){target="_blank"} is an awesome repository of useful data for practicing your data `Wrangling` skills.

We will work with the `Volcano Eruptions` data as a case study for using the `glimpse()` function for examining your data prior to further exploration.


```{r}
# Load Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(DataExplorer)
library(rmarkdown)

# Import Data
volcano_raw_tbl <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/volcano.csv')
```


### Data Examimation with print()

The tidyverse version of a `data.frame` is a `tibble` and when printed to the RStudio console they provide an overview of your data. 

When our data has only a few columns the tibble printed to the console is awesome! The user gets a quick overview of their data e.g., data-types, column count, etc.

Let's filter our volcano data to see what this in action.


```{r}
# Slice data to limit the view
print(volcano_raw_tbl[ , 0:4], n = 3)
```

That's awesome! 

A clean view is returned that with information that allows the user to quickly examine there data. But what about if our data has many columns as is the case with the `Volcanos Data`? 

```{r}
print(volcano_raw_tbl, n = 5)
```


### Data Examination with glimpse()

Printing that many columns into the console makes the process of examining the data cumbersome; the columns being wrapped show the data-type for the columns but it's difficult to extract that info. Also, for the wrapped columns you don't see what the data types are.

So why not just use the `tibble::view()` function and open the data in the RStudio Data Window? That's a great idea but even before we go there we really want to get a sense of our data and the associated data types.

I recommend using the `glimpse()` function and using it early ðŸ˜Ž

```{r}
volcano_raw_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

### Let's subset some of these data for exploration

I've done GIS work before and so I'm really interested in mapping some of these data.

The population counts based on proximity to volcanoes sounds really interesting so let's start there.

```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl <- volcano_raw_tbl %>% 
    select(contains('volcano_n'), country, contains('tude'), contains('population'))

volcano_raw_subset_tbl
```

### Simpler to work with Less at First

We've reduced our data down to just 8 columns but it's still a bit difficult to get a full view of what it contains.

Let's use the `glimpse()` function again to get a better view.

```{r}
glimpse(volcano_raw_subset_tbl)
```


### Data Examination Cont.

Before exploring and wrangling this data further, let's examine it a little closer

### Any missing data?

...

```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl %>% 
    profile_missing() %>% 
    arrange(desc(num_missing)) %>% 
    rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

### Any duplicated records?

looks like all the vol-nums are unique, and:
* names are'nt suprising to be dups (diff countries?)
* country, name should show no dups (but there is one)
    * let's research that...

...

```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl %>% count(volcano_number, sort = T)
```


```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl %>% count(volcano_name, sort = T) %>% filter(n==2)
```

```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl %>% count(volcano_name, country, sort = T) %>% filter(n==2)
```

```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl %>% filter(volcano_name == 'Sumbing') %>% 
    glimpse()
```
