### What to Expect 

I'm excited to share pro-tips that will expedite your process for cleaning and standardizing column names in your data; this is a critical yet sometimes overlooked step in the cleaning + tidying of data.

There are a couple of handy `functions()` available in `R` to help effectively execute these tasks.

By the end of this short article you'll have a couple of new tricks up your sleeve for getting those column names just the way you want them üòé

### Data Wrangling Toolkit üß∞

* The `clean_names()` function from the [janitor](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/janitor/versions/1.2.0/topics/clean_names) library.
* The `set_names()` function from the [purrr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rlang/versions/0.2.2/topics/set_names) library.


### Load our Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)      # Work-Horse Package
library(tidytuesdayR)   # Access Data from Tidy Tuesday
library(janitor)        # Data Cleaning Package
library(purrr)          # Functional Programming Toolkit
```

### Let's Get Some Data

I'm grabbing a couple of data-sets from the [Tidy Tuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday){target="_blank"} that will help us walk through a couple of examples together.

```{r}
# Get Marine Mammal Data
cetacean_week    <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2018-12-18")
cetacean_raw_tbl <- cetacean_week$allCetaceanData 

# Get NFL Salary Data
nfl_salary_week    <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2018-04-09")
nfl_salary_raw_tbl <- nfl_salary_week$nfl_salary
```

Each of these data-sets contain column naming useful for emphasizing the value in the aforementioned functions.

Let's start with the `janitor` library and it's nifty function called `clean_names()`.


### Janitor Makes Life Easy

My head exploded ü§Ø when learning about the `Janitor` library - it's one of my favorite's and I use the `clean_names()` function ALL the time.

Standardizing our naming convention upfront in our data cleaning pipeline can save enormous amounts of time downstream. I'm a big fan of the üêç `snake_case` üêç naming convention and so I typically like the columns of my data to follow that pattern.

Fortunately, the `janitor::clean_names()` function has built in `functionality` to programmatically clean up our column names - my favorite part is that by default it favors the `snake_case` naming convention.

### Let's Look at an Example

Pulling a few columns from our marine-mammal data we see that our columns are not in our preferred `snake_case` convention.

```{r}
# Get subset of columns for example
cetacean_subset_tbl <- cetacean_raw_tbl %>% 
    
    # Select columns using helper_functions()
    select(contains("origin"), contains("date"), COD)

# Transpose Data to view Column Names
glimpse(cetacean_subset_tbl)
```

### Mixed Naming, Let's Standardize

As you can see we've got columns in lowerCamel and also in UPPERCASE. To standardize, let's now use the `clean_names()` function to tidy these up.

```{r}
# Clean up Column Names + Glimpse Output
cetacean_subset_tbl %>% 
    clean_names() %>% 
    glimpse()
```

#### Those Column Names Look Great!

Now imagine you have a picky partner/colleague who insists on a format like ALLCAPS - you've tried to convince them otherwise but they insist üôÑ

```{r}
# Standardize Column Naming - ALLCAPS
cetacean_cols_allcaps_tbl <- cetacean_subset_tbl %>% 
    clean_names(case = "all_caps")

# Glimpse Output
cetacean_cols_allcaps_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

### Awesome!

Nice way to be a team-player üëç

### Next Example: `set_names()`

With `clean_names()` in our tool bag, we can now combine it with `set_names()` to programmatically standardize ALL of our column names using advanced techniques.

Let's take a quick peak at the columns from the NFL Salary data.

```{r}
nfl_salary_raw_tbl %>% names() 
```

Now imagine  instead of requiring snake_case, the columns need to be lower-case with a `dash` instead of an `underscore` in between words.

The `set_names()` function allows us to `Set the Names of a Vector` programmatically. 

Using the `names()` function above, we can pass a vector of our column names and manipulate each name in similar fashion.

Let's look at an example.

```{r}
nfl_salary_raw_tbl %>% 
    clean_names() %>% 
    names()
```

We've effectively used `clean_names()` to quickly clean up our column names.

However, we still need to replace those underscores with dashes.

Check this out üòé


```{r}
nfl_salary_raw_tbl %>% 
    clean_names() %>% 
    set_names(names(.) %>% str_replace_all("_", "-")) %>% 
    glimpse()
```


I learned this trick in the [Data Science for Business 101](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-101-r-business-analysis-r/?coupon_code=DS4B15&affcode=173166_vnvxtqbd){target="_blank"} course taught by [Matt Dancho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdancho/){target="_blank"}.

At first, I was puzzled by the `names(.)` component and didn't understand what the `period` was doing. In the course I learned that using the `dot` (.) enables passing the incoming tibble to `multiple-spots` in the function.

`set_names()` is a vectorized function and so the first argument is a vector. The `dot` functionality in `R` allows us to take the incoming tibble and pass it to the `names(.)` function. Once we have the names in a vector we use the `str_replace_all()` function to replace the `underscore` with a `dash`.

The `str_replace_all()` function uses regular expression pattern matching and so the options are endless for how creative you can get here.


### Wrap-Up

That's it for today!

We used `clean_names()` and `set_names()` to effectively standardize our column naming conventions.

If anyone has more insights to the `dot` (.) functionality used here, I humbly ask that you provide insights or links to resources that will better help others understand it - `myself included`
