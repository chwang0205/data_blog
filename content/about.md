### CONTEXT


My name is Jason Dexter and I'm an `R-Programmer` and `Data-Analyst` based out of Berkeley, CA, where I live with my wife 💃 and our two cats 🐈 🐈

In graduate school I was introduced to programming, first `base-R` then `Python`. The idea 💡 of solving problems programmatically resonated deeply with me and I've been hooked ever since.

I'm a nerd 🤓 when it comes to automating data manipulation - there's something intoxicating about the process of wrangling data using `code` - it's simply amazing! 

I find immense satisfaction in determining the shape data needs to be in, then programmatically crafting a solution to transform the raw-data into something useful.


### R-CENTRIC

Eventually I gravitated towards `R`, especially after [Matt Dancho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdancho/) introduced me to the `Tidyverse`. Matt has an online learning platform for Data Science that has been a real game-changer for me.

It's called [Business Science Unviersity](https://www.business-science.io/?affcode=173166_vnvxtqbd) and I can't recommend it enough.  


### WHAT TO EXPECT

Posts at `Exploring-Data` will take an `R`-Centric approach to Wrangling + Exploring data. The posts will typically be bite-size with content that is applicable - my goal is to have the posts act as a library of useful tips + tricks for programmatically solving problems related to data.

I personally find the `R` language to be deeply satisfying to learn. The options really are endless.

More importantly, the `R-Community` is hands down top-notch 😎
