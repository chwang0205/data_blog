### Context

Recently, I completed the `Data Science Foundations` course by [Matt Dancho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdancho/){target="_blank"} over at [Business Science University](https://www.business-science.io/?affcode=173166_vnvxtqbd){target="_blank"}. The course was action packed and the instructors intention was obviously to rapidly move novice users of R towards expertise within 7 weeks (e.g., applied Machine-Learning).

In the course you get to code along side an expert `Data Scientist` while he teaches you to think critically when using data to solve problems that drive ROIx.

Hands down, this is one of my favorite courses because it takes students through the entire process of learning how to import, examine, wrangle, explore, visualize, model, and communicate findings to the business.



### Courses without Application are Pointless

While it's easy to take a course on a subject it's much more difficult to Transfer that Learning by applying new concepts from one context to another - that's why I'm a BIG proponent of 'project-based' learning.

For that reason, I'm doing a series of posts to solidify and share my learnings from the [Data Science Foundations](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-101-r-business-analysis-r/?coupon_code=DS4B15&affcode=173166_vnvxtqbd) course that I recently completed.

### Let's Dive into an Example

I'm a nerd ðŸ¤“ when it comes to programming and love learning about new functions.

Matt Dancho early in his 101 course teaches students the importance of examining data before diving into wrangling and exploring it further.

One of the functions I've adopted from the course is the `glimpse()` function - it's awesome and I use it all the time!

### The glimse() function

When your data has a small number of columns you can print it to the console in `RStudio`. However, when there are many columns it's much more difficult to get a quick view of your data.

Let's look at an example so I can stress the value in using the `dplyr::glimpse()` function in the examination of your data.

### Let's Get Some Data

The [Tidy Tuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday){target="_blank"} is an awesome repository of useful data for practicing your data `Wrangling` skills.

We will work with the 'Volcano Eruptions' data as a case study for using the `glimpse()` function for examining your data prior to further exploration.

...

```{r}
# Load Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(DataExplorer)
library(rmarkdown)

# Import Data
volcano_raw_tbl <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/volcano.csv')
```


### Data Examimation

Something about how the tibble view is cumbersome and doesn't provide a good view of 'wide' data.
...

```{r}
volcano_raw_tbl
```

Something about how awesome the `glimpse()` function is.

```{r}
volcano_raw_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

### Let's subset some of these data for exploration

I've done GIS work before and so I'm really interested in mapping some of these data.

The population counts based on proximity to volcanoes sounds really interesting so let's start there.

```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl <- volcano_raw_tbl %>% 
    select(contains('volcano_n'), country, contains('tude'), contains('population'))

volcano_raw_subset_tbl
```

### Simpler to work with Less at First

We've reduced our data down to just 8 columns but it's still a bit difficult to get a full view of what it contains.

Let's use the `glimpse()` function again to get a better view.

```{r}
glimpse(volcano_raw_subset_tbl)
```


### Data Examination Cont.

Before exploring and wrangling this data further, let's examine it a little closer

### Any missing data?

...

```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl %>% 
    profile_missing() %>% 
    arrange(desc(num_missing)) %>% 
    rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

### Any duplicated records?

looks like all the vol-nums are unique, and:
* names are'nt suprising to be dups (diff countries?)
* country, name should show no dups (but there is one)
    * let's research that...

...

```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl %>% count(volcano_number, sort = T)
```


```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl %>% count(volcano_name, sort = T) %>% filter(n==2)
```

```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl %>% count(volcano_name, country, sort = T) %>% filter(n==2)
```

```{r}
volcano_raw_subset_tbl %>% filter(volcano_name == 'Sumbing') %>% 
    glimpse()
```
