### Quick Overview

`Exploring Data` is a place where I share easily digestible content aimed at making the wrangling and exploration of data more efficient (+more fun).

### New Series: Exploring R {packages}

When I discover new and helpful `functions` I light up ðŸ’¡ with excitement. 

Interestingly, I have a pattern of finding one or two useful `functions` in a `{package}`, but rarely explore `{packages}` further for other useful `functionality`.

That's what this New Series is all about ðŸ˜Ž

Each post will share a bit about how I was using the `{package}` and then use a case-study to highlight other `functionality` I found to be useful.



### janitor {package}

This a wonderful `{package}` built by [Sam Firke](https://github.com/sfirke){target="_blank"}.

Take the time to explore the [Github page for the `{package}`](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor){target="_blank"} where Sam describes the packages as follow:

> janitor has simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data. It was built with beginning and intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do everything covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save their thinking for the fun stuff.

Let's dive into our case-study. We will be going over the following:

1. A tip for setting up a pre-processing pipepline.
2. The `function` I use all the time: `janitor::clean_names`
3. Two newly discovered `functions`: 


### Load our Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(janitor)
# lsf.str("package:janitor") %>% tibble()
```

### Import data

For our case-study we are using data from the [Tidy Tuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday){target="_blank"}.

```{r, results="hide"}
# Import Data ----
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2018-05-07") 
coffee_chains <- tuesdata$week6_coffee_chains
```


```{r}
coffee_chains %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(brand, store_number, store_name, country, city) %>%
  get_dupes()
```
