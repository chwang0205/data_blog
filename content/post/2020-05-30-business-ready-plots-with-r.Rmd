### Quick Context

Recently, I completed the Data Science for Business 101 course over at Business Science University. In the course, Matt Dancho teaches students the fundamentals of data science for business with the `tidyverse.` The course is jam packed with material and I highly recommend to anyone looking to advance their skills.

I've been tracking down data then applying the techniques from the course to solidify what I learned in the course. One of my favorite parts from Week 1 is turning a generic ggplot() into something that is Business Ready.

In this post I'll show you how to upgrade your plots in `R` so that they are Business-Ready.

### The Final Plot

This is the plot that we will recreate in the post - it's crisp, clean, and Business-Ready.

Let's get started ðŸ˜Ž

### Load our Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)  # Work-Horse Package
library(tidyquant)  # Business Ready Plots 
library(scales)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
#edu_census_data_raw_tbl <- read_csv("static/01_data/edu_census_data.csv")
```

### Let's Get Some Data

These are Census data that I got here: link to data

The original data was 4.M rows and so I've already filtered it down a bit.

```{r}
# Import Data
edu_census_data_raw_tbl <- read_csv("../../static/01_data/edu_census_data.csv")

# Glimpse Data
edu_census_data_raw_tbl %>% glimpse()
```


### Filter Data for Plotting

We want to compare educational attainment statistics for the County of Los Angeles against the rest of the Nation - first let's do a bit of filtering to get those data.

```{r}
# Setup variables: for filter + for using in plot later
year_f <- 2018
nation <- "United States"
county <- "Los Angeles County"

# Data Prep
edu_census_filtered_tbl <- edu_census_data_raw_tbl %>% 
    
    # Filter data to year and areas of interest 
    filter(year == year_f,
           name == nation | # OR
           str_detect(name, county))

# View data
edu_census_filtered_tbl
```

The 10 x 5 table is exactly what we need to create our first plot.

Making a visualization is a great way to get a few insights in the process of better understanding your data.


### Generic ggplot()

The awesomeness of `ggplot()` is that we can rapidly produce a plot with just a couple of lines of code - that means we can quickly get insights that will help determine the next steps in `Exploring` these `Data` further.

The stacked bar-chart below is a great starting place. 


```{r, fig.height=3}
edu_census_filtered_tbl %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = name)) +
    geom_col() 
```

We can immediately see that 'some' differences exist but it's difficult to get a sense of the magnitude. It's also difficult to make out the names of the variables on the x-axis.


### Business Ready Plots

To get those plots business-ready, it's helpful and a best-practice to break things up into two steps:

1. Data Manipulation (Wrangling)
2. Data Visualization

The data manipulation step will pay-off immensely once we get to the data visualization step; this was a key learning from Matt in the 101 course - it keeps your code nice and tidy too ðŸ¤“

### 1) Data Manipulation

```{r}
# Step 1 - Manipulate Data
data_manipulated_tbl <- edu_census_filtered_tbl %>% 
    
    # Selecting columns to focus on
    select(name, variable, value) %>% 
    
    # Tidy up variable names
    mutate(variable = str_replace(variable, "percent_", ""),
           variable = str_replace_all(variable, "_", " "),
           variable = str_to_title(variable)) %>% 
    
    # Convert value to a pct (ratio)
    mutate(pct = value / 100) %>% 
    
    # Format % Text 
    mutate(pct_text = scales::percent(pct, accuracy = 0.1)) %>% 
    
    # Select final columns for plotting
    select(name, variable, contains("pct"))
```


Now that we've wrangled + manipulated our data, let's take a peak at it before diving into generating our visualization.


```{r}
data_manipulated_tbl
```

Creating the `pct_text` column will come in handy for adding clean labels to our plot - this will be a nice touch that will help the audience quickly make sense of the chart.


### 2) Data Visualization

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=8}
# Step 2 - Visualize Data
data_visualized_plot <- data_manipulated_tbl %>% 
    
    # Setup ggplot() canvas for plotting
    ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = pct, fill = name)) +
    
    # Geometries
    geom_col() +
    geom_label(aes(label = pct_text), fill = "white", hjust = "center") +
    
    # Facet: splits plot into multiple plots by a categorical feature
    facet_wrap(~ name) +
    
    # Flip coordinates for readable variable names
    coord_flip() +
    
    # Formatting
    theme_tq() +
    scale_fill_tq() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 1.0)) +
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
    labs(title = str_glue("Comparison of Educational Attainment ({year_f})"),
         subtitle = str_glue("{county} vs. Overall National Statistics"),
         caption  = "Census Data",
         x = "", y = "") 
```


We now have our two steps completed with our code pretty well commented.

Let's take a look at our plot ðŸ˜Ž

```{r,  fig.height=3.5, fig.width=8}
data_visualized_plot
```
